# CampusQuest

CampusQuest is a gamified web-based platform designed to enhance student engagement in extracurricular activities and campus events. This platform incentivizes students to participate in various campus activities through a rewards and recognition system. Students can complete activities (known as "quests"), earn points, and compete on a leaderboard to be recognized as top contributors to campus life. By fostering healthy competition, CampusQuest aims to create a more vibrant and involved campus community.
